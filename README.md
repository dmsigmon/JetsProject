## Jet Project
- the Jet project is a Project that helps put together all aspects of Object Oriented principles. Creating a fleet of jets with different capabilities that will use an application class with a main method. Given a menu, access different information about the different jets.


#### Abstraction
- using interfaces to practice with abstract methods and to sort classes

#### Polymorphism
- Building subclasses from one Jet class and adding different features to other types of Jet classes (Cargo, Fighter, etc).

#### Inheritience
- inheriting different fields from the parent (Jet) class and specific methods from interfaces(CargoCarrier, CombatReady) to build new classes(cargo jet, fighter jet) with common features but different capabilities.

#### Ecncapsulation
encapsulating all fields to their parent (Jet) class(making them private fields) to make sure the only way another class can use the field is through a method.
